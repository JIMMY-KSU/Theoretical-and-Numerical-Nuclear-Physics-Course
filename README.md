Contents and bibliography (essential bibliography can be found in the forked repositories)

1) Basic notions of nuclear physics and its main theoretical aspects essential to the development of the course. Second quantization elements: creation and destruction operators of single particles for bosons and fermions. Representation of states and operators. Calculation of amplitudes and matrix elements. Field operators. Wick's theorem. Algebra of angular momentum.


2) Nuclear potentials. Phenomenology of nuclear potentials (phase-shifts, scattering lengths, effective ranges). Non-relativistic formulation in the space of coordinates and relativistic in the space of momenta with particular attention to the most recent chiral approaches. Scattering theory. Lippmann-Schwinger equation (analytical treatment and numerical solution with Gauss integration). Comparison with experimental data. Theoretical description and numerical treatment of deuteron. Three-body forces. Faddeev equations for systems interacting for few-body systems. Application of the renormalization group to nuclear potential (Vlowk and Vsrg) and numerical implementation of the procedure.
